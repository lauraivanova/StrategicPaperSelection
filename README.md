# StrategicPaperSelection
Programs used to simulate strategies to solve the paper selection problem

PROBLEM: 
Suppose you have a collection of n pieces of paper, and each piece bears a positive random number. The underlying distribution of these random numbers is unknown. Importantly, each number is unique, with no repetitions. Your task is to select one paper at a time from this set without replacement. Your ultimate objective is to identify and select the paper with the
highest number.
At each step of the process, you must decide whether the current paper has the highest number among the remaining papers. If you decide that the number is not the largest, you choose the next one, and so on until the papers are exhausted. If you make the correct decision and select the paper with the highest number, you win a prize of e1000. However, if your decision is incorrect and you do not choose the paper with the highest number, you receive no prize.
Design a few strategies and evaluate the probability of winning for each strategy.
